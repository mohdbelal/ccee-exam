11) Overview of OS - Chapter 1 from Silverchatz book
===

12) Introduction to Linux
===

	Linux has four major parts:

	The kernel
		The low-level operating system, handling files, disks, net‐
		working, and other necessities we take for granted. Most
		users rarely notice the kernel.
	
	Supplied programs
		Thousands of programs for file manipulation, text editing,
		mathematics, web browsing, audio, video, computer pro‐
		gramming, typesetting, encryption, DVD burning...you
		name it.
	
	The shell
		A user interface for typing commands, executing them,
		and displaying the results. Linux has various shells: the
		Bourne shell, Korn shell, C shell, and others. bash, the Bourne-Again Shell, 
                which is often the default for user accounts. However, all these shells
		have similar basic functions.
	X
		A graphical system that provides windows, menus, icons,
		mouse support, and other familiar GUI elements. More
		complex graphical environments are built on X; the most
		popular are KDE and GNOME. We’ll discuss only a few
		programs that open X windows to run.

13) The Linux File System
===

	File holds data. In order to distinguish the contents, we name the files.
	
	Directory is a special file which holds together other file(s).
                               ----
	Note: Directory equivalent to Folder in Windows

	Concept of a sub-directory

	If a directory named as P contains a file called as S and if S is also directory on its own then S is called subdirectory of P. 
        P in this case is called Parent directory.

	Top most directory in Linux is denoted by / and is called root directory.

	All the files descent from root directory in Linux environment.

	In order to refer file(s), we have two mechanisms to address::
	i)  Absolutel path
	ii) Relative path

	Absolute path starts with root directory. E.g., P s a directory and contains sub-directory called as S and S contains a file called as F then 

	Absolutel path for referring F would be 

	/P/S/F

	Relative Path concept emerges based on your current position in the file system.

	Current position in the file system is denoted by .(period)

	.. refers to one level above w.r.t. current position.


	Filesystem in Linux/Unix/UNIX is Hierarchical

        Demonstrate FS on the Laptop
	/ /bin /usr/bin /etc /var/adm


14) Working with Files and Directories
===

	mkdir

	mkdir -p

	cd

	rmdir

	rm

	rm -rf 
	recursively deletes a given directory


        Concept of home directory and HOME

        Directory traversing and file access demo using absolute path and relative path.

	cat

	ls

	more

Categories for programs
-----------------------
bin 	Programs (usually binary files)
sbin 	Programs (usually binary files) intended to be run by the superuser
lib 	Libraries of code used by programs

Categories for documentation
----------------------------
doc 	Documentation
info 	Documentation files for emacs’s built-in help system
man 	Documentation files (manual pages) displayed by the man program; the files are often compressed and are sprinkled with typesetting commands for man to interpret share Program-specific files, such as examples and installation instructions

Categories for configuration
----------------------------
etc 	Configuration files for the system (and other miscellaneous stuff)
init.d 	Configuration files for booting Linux
rc.d 	Configuration files for booting Linux; also rc1.d, rc2.d, ...

Categories for programming
--------------------------
include	 Header files for programming

Categories for web files
------------------------
cgi-bin 	Scripts/programs that run on web pages
html 		Web pages
public_html 	Web pages, typically in users’ home directories
www	 	Web pages

Categories for display
----------------------
fonts		Fonts (surprise!)
X11 		X window system files

Categories for hardware
-----------------------
dev 		Device files for interfacing with disks and other hardware
media Mount points: directories that provide access to disks
mnt 		Mount points: directories that provide access to disks

Categories for runtime files
----------------------------

var 		Files specific to this computer, created and updated as the computer runs

lock 		Lock files, created by programs to say, “I am running”; the existence of a lock file may prevent another program, or another instance of the same program, from running or performing an
action

log 		Log files that track important system events, containing error, warning, and informational messages

mail Mailboxes for incoming mail

run 		PID files, which contain the IDs of running processes; these files are often consulted to track or kill particular processes

spool 		Files queued or in transit, such as outgoing email, print jobs, and scheduled jobs
tmp Temporary storage for programs and/or people to use

proc 		Operating system state

/usr 		More system files supplied with Linux (pronounced “user”)

/usr/local 	System files developed “locally,” either for your organization or your individual computer

/usr/games 	Games


Operating System Directories
----------------------------

/boot		 Files for booting the system. This is where the kernel lives, typically named /boot/vmlinuz or similar.  /lost+found	 Damaged files that were rescued by a disk recovery tool.

/proc		 Describes currently running processes; for advanced users.

System Directories
------------------

	/bin, /sbin, /lib, /etc, 
        /dev, /mnt, /media
	/var, /var/log, /var/spool
	/usr/bin, /usr/local, /usr/games, /usr/include

	/boot, /lost+found, /proc
